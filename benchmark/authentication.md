## Authentication

This section defines controls related to user authentication in Salesforce production environments. These controls ensure that organizations implement strong identity verification mechanisms, centralize authentication through Single Sign-On, and maintain proper governance over authentication exceptions to reduce the attack surface and enforce consistent identity management practices.

### SBS-AUTH-001: Enable Organization-Wide SSO Enforcement Setting

**Control Statement:** Salesforce production orgs must enable the org-level setting that disables Salesforce credential logins for all users.

**Description:**  
Production orgs must enforce SSO authentication at the organizational level by enabling the "Disable login with Salesforce credentials" setting. This setting prevents all users from authenticating with Salesforce usernames and passwords, requiring SSO authentication instead. Individual users can still be exempted from this requirement using the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission (governed by SBS-AUTH-002).

**Risk:** <Badge type="danger" text="Critical" />  
Without the org-level SSO enforcement setting enabled, users can authenticate directly to Salesforce using local credentials—creating a parallel authentication path outside centralized identity management. This establishes an uncontrolled security boundary: password-based attacks (credential stuffing, phishing, brute force) can target Salesforce directly, enabling unauthorized access without requiring any other control to fail. Attackers bypass organizational identity controls, MFA policies, and session management enforced at the IdP layer. This setting is the primary technical control that establishes the SSO security boundary.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Retrieve `SingleSignOnSettings` (part of `SecuritySettings`) via Metadata API or navigate to Setup → Single Sign-On Settings in the UI.
2. Verify that `isLoginWithSalesforceCredentialsDisabled` is set to `true`.
3. Flag the org if the setting is not enabled.

**Remediation:**  
1. Navigate to Setup → Single Sign-On Settings.
2. Enable **Disable login with Salesforce credentials**.
3. Validate that SSO is properly configured and functional before enabling this setting to prevent lockout.
4. Ensure approved break-glass or administrative accounts have the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission removed via their profiles or permission sets so they can still authenticate if needed.

**Default Value:**  
By default, Salesforce does not enable "Disable login with Salesforce credentials." All users can authenticate with Salesforce usernames and passwords unless this setting is explicitly enabled.

### SBS-AUTH-002: Govern and Document All Users Permitted to Bypass Single Sign-On

**Control Statement:** All users who do not have the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission must be explicitly authorized, documented in a system of record, and limited to approved administrative or break-glass use cases.

**Description:**  
When the org-level SSO enforcement setting (SBS-AUTH-001) is enabled, users without the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission can still authenticate using Salesforce credentials—effectively bypassing SSO. Production orgs must maintain an authoritative inventory of all such accounts, documenting their justification, role, and approval. These accounts should be limited to approved administrative or break-glass scenarios only.

**Risk:** <Badge type="tip" text="Moderate" />  
Users permitted to bypass SSO represent exceptions to centralized identity governance. Without formal documentation and approval, these accounts can proliferate unnoticed—reducing visibility into access patterns and undermining audit readiness. However, this control provides assurance and governance rather than establishing a security boundary. Undocumented exceptions increase operational risk and reduce audit readiness but require credential compromise for direct security impact.

**Audit Procedure:**
1. Query all user records to identify users who do **not** have the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" (`PermissionsIsSsoEnabled`) permission assigned through their profile or permission sets.
2. Verify each identified user appears in the approved system-of-record inventory with documented business justification, owner, and approval.
3. Confirm each exception is authorized for administrative or break-glass purposes only.
4. Validate that these accounts follow strong local authentication controls (e.g., strong password policies, MFA if applicable).
5. Flag any user without documented approval.
6. (Optional) Download API Total Usage logs (EventLogFile - ApiTotalUsage, available in free tier of Event Monitoring) to monitor SSO bypass account activity:
   - Filter API activity by users identified as SSO bypass accounts.
   - Review frequency and timing of API calls to verify usage aligns with documented break-glass purposes.
   - Flag any SSO bypass accounts with regular or unexpected API activity for review against documented justifications.

**Remediation:**  
1. Create or update a formal inventory documenting all SSO-bypass users with their business justification, owner, and approval date.
2. For any undocumented or unjustified users: assign the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission via their profile or permission sets to remove SSO-bypass capability.
3. Ensure all documented exceptions adhere to least-privilege access and strong authentication controls.  
4. Establish periodic (e.g., quarterly) review of all SSO-bypass accounts.

**Default Value:**  
By default, no users are assigned the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission, meaning all users can authenticate with Salesforce credentials. Once SBS-AUTH-001 is implemented and the org-level setting is enabled, users must be explicitly assigned this permission to require SSO authentication.

### SBS-AUTH-003: Prohibit Broad or Unrestricted Profile Login IP Ranges

**Control Statement:** Profiles in Salesforce production orgs must not contain login IP ranges that effectively permit access from the full public internet or other overly broad ranges that bypass network-based access controls.

**Description:**  
Any profile-level login IP range must reflect explicitly authorized organizational network boundaries. Profiles must not include universally permissive ranges—such as `0.0.0.0–255.255.255.255` or other combinations that allow access from all or nearly all IP addresses—as these configurations disable intended Salesforce network restrictions and undermine authentication controls.

**Risk:** <Badge type="tip" text="Moderate" />  
Overly broad login IP ranges effectively disable network-based access controls, allowing authentication from any location on the internet. However, exploitation requires credentials to be compromised first—this control provides defense-in-depth rather than establishing a primary security boundary. When authentication controls (SBS-AUTH-001) are enforced, IP restrictions serve as an additional layer that limits the blast radius of credential compromise.

**Audit Procedure:**
1. Retrieve all profile login IP ranges via **Setup → Profiles → Login IP Ranges** or by querying the Profile metadata (`loginIpRanges` field) using the Metadata API.
2. For each profile, enumerate all configured login IP ranges.
3. Identify any ranges that:
   - Cover the entire IPv4 space, or
   - Represent effectively unrestricted access (e.g., `0.0.0.0–255.255.255.255`, `1.1.1.1–255.255.255.255`, or similar patterns).
4. Confirm that all IP ranges align with organizational security policy and defined network boundaries.
5. Flag any profile with an impermissible or overly broad range.
6. Download API Total Usage logs (EventLogFile - ApiTotalUsage, available in free tier of Event Monitoring) to validate IP restrictions are effective:
   - Extract unique `CLIENT_IP` values from recent API activity.
   - Compare against documented approved organizational network ranges.
   - Identify any new or unexpected IP addresses making API calls.
   - Cross-reference unusual IPs with profile assignments to identify potential policy gaps.

**Remediation:**
1. Remove any profile login IP ranges that effectively grant unrestricted global access.  
2. Replace them with IP ranges that correspond to approved corporate networks, office locations, VPN ingress points, or other authorized infrastructure.  
3. Validate that updated network restrictions do not block legitimate access paths and that users can authenticate through sanctioned networks.  
4. Establish an internal governance process to review and approve all future additions of profile login IP ranges.

**Default Value:**  
Salesforce profiles do not include login IP ranges by default; they must be explicitly configured.

### SBS-AUTH-004: Enforce Strong Multi-Factor Authentication for External Users with Substantial Access to Sensitive Data 

**Control Statement:** 
All Salesforce interactive authentication flows for external human users with substantial access to sensitive data must enforce multi-factor authentication that includes at least one strong authentication factor.

**Description:**  
Salesforce must be configured so that every interactive login method available to external human users with substantial access to sensitive data enforces multi-factor authentication using either a strong second factor in addition to a password, or a passwordless flow requiring two or more factors with at least one strong factor, regardless of whether authentication is performed directly by Salesforce or via a single sign-on identity provider.

Organizations must document in their system of record:
1. **Definition of "substantial access to sensitive data"** — The organization's interpretation of what data classifications or access levels constitute substantial access for purposes of this control.
2. **Identification of in-scope users** — Either a list of specific users, or the combination of Salesforce access controls (profiles, permission sets, etc.) that result in substantial access.

**Example system-of-record entry:**
- **Definition:** "Substantial access to sensitive data" means access to Personally Identifiable Information (as defined under GDPR) relating to individuals other than the user themselves, or access to Special Category Data (as defined under GDPR) relating to any individual.
- **In-scope users:** All users assigned the "Service Channel Partner" profile.

For the purposes of this control, a strong authentication factor is defined as an authentication factor that is resistant to phishing, replay, and credential stuffing attacks. Acceptable strong authentication factors include:
 - Push-notification based authenticator app such as Salesforce Authenticator or Okta Verify
 - RFC 6238 compliant Time-based One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP) authenticator app
 - FIDO2 hardware key compliant with either WebAuthn or U2F standard
 - Biometric authentication such as Touch ID or Windows Hello

**Risk:** <Badge type="danger" text="Critical" />  
Without enforced multi-factor authentication, external users with substantial access to sensitive data can authenticate using only a password—establishing a single point of failure for the authentication boundary. External users present elevated credential risk due to weaker identity proofing, less organizational oversight, and exposure to consumer-grade phishing attacks. Attackers who compromise a single password through phishing, credential stuffing, or account takeover gain direct access to sensitive data without requiring any other control to fail. This creates an unprotected authentication path to high-value data that bypasses the defense-in-depth protections applied to internal users.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Enumerate all active external human users with substantial access to sensitive data.
2. Validate that in-scope users have the “Multi-Factor Authentication for User Interface Logins” permission through profiles or permission sets.
3. Flag any in-scope users who lack the “Multi-Factor Authentication for User Interface Logins” permission.

**Remediation:**  
1. Apply the “Multi-Factor Authentication for User Interface Logins” permission through profiles or permission sets for all active external users with substantial access to sensitive data.
2. Configure suitable strong second-factor options in Setup -> Identity -> Identity Verification (e.g., authenticator app, FIDO2 security key).

**Default Value:**  
By default, Salesforce does not enforce strong multi-factor authentication for all external user login flows, and external users may authenticate using single-factor or weak-factor methods unless explicitly restricted by configuration.
