# Controls At-a-Glance

This page provides a quick reference to all SBS control statements. Each control statement is a concise, single-sentence summary of the requirement. For full details including rationale, audit procedures, and remediation steps, refer to the individual control sections.

## Foundations

Organizations must formally install all connected apps and must control access to each installed app exclusively through assigned profiles or permission sets.

**SBS-OAUTH-002: Inventory and Criticality Classification of OAuth-Enabled Connected Apps**  
All OAuth-enabled Connected Apps must be recorded in an authoritative system of record and assigned a documented vendor criticality rating reflecting integration importance and data sensitivity.

**SBS-OAUTH-003: Due Diligence Documentation for High-Risk Connected App Vendors**  
Organizations must review and retain available security documentation for all high-risk Connected App vendors and explicitly record any missing documentation as part of the vendor assessment.

## Integrations

**SBS-INT-001: Enforce Governance of Browser Extensions Accessing Salesforce**  
Organizations must enforce a centrally managed mechanism that restricts which browser extensions are permitted to access Salesforce, and must not allow the use of unmanaged or uncontrolled extensions.

**SBS-INT-002: Inventory and Justification of Remote Site Settings**  
Organizations must maintain an authoritative inventory of all Remote Site Settings and document a business justification for each endpoint approved for Apex HTTP callouts.

**SBS-INT-003: Inventory and Justification of Named Credentials**  
Organizations must maintain an authoritative inventory of all Named Credentials and document a business justification for each external endpoint and authentication configuration approved for use in Salesforce.

## Permissions

**SBS-PERM-001: Enforce a Documented Permission Set Model**  
All permission sets, permission set groups, and profiles must conform to a documented model maintained in a system of record and enforced continuously.

**SBS-PERM-002: Documented Justification for All API-Enabled Authorizations**  
Every authorization granting the "API Enabled" permission must have documented business or technical justification recorded in a system of record.

**SBS-PERM-003: Documented Justification for Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps Permission**  
The "Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps" permission must only be assigned to highly trusted users with documented justification and must not be granted to end-users.

**SBS-PERM-004: Documented Justification for All Super Admin–Equivalent Users**  
All users with simultaneous View All Data, Modify All Data, and Manage Users permissions must be documented in a system of record with clear business or technical justification.

## Authentication

**SBS-AUTH-001: Enforce Single Sign-On for All Standard Production Users**  
Salesforce production orgs must enforce Single Sign-On (SSO) for all standard users by enabling the org-level setting that disables Salesforce credential logins and assigning the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission to all non-exempt accounts.

**SBS-AUTH-002: Govern and Document All Users Permitted to Bypass Single Sign-On**  
All users who do not have the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission must be explicitly authorized, documented in a system of record, and limited to approved administrative or break-glass use cases.

**SBS-AUTH-003: Enforce a Minimum Global Password Policy for Local Authentication**  
Salesforce production orgs that permit any local (non-SSO) authentication must configure the global password policy to meet or exceed the ISSB-defined minimum baseline for password strength, lifetime, reuse prevention, lockout, and reset handling.

**SBS-AUTH-004: Prohibit Broad or Unrestricted Profile Login IP Ranges**  
Profiles in Salesforce production orgs must not contain login IP ranges that effectively permit access from the full public internet or other overly broad ranges that bypass network-based access controls.

## Code Security

**SBS-CODE-001: Mandatory Peer Review for Salesforce Code Changes**  
All Salesforce code changes must undergo peer review and receive approval before merging into any production-bound branch.

**SBS-CODE-002: Pre-Merge Static Code Analysis for Apex and LWC**  
Static code analysis with security checks for Apex and Lightning Web Components must execute successfully before any code change is merged into a production-bound branch.

**SBS-CODE-003: Implement Persistent Apex Application Logging**  
Organizations must implement an Apex-based logging framework that writes application log events to durable Salesforce storage and must not rely on transient Salesforce debug logs for operational or security investigations.

## Data Security

**SBS-DATA-001: Implement Mechanisms to Detect Regulated Data in Long Text Area Fields**  
The organization must implement a mechanism that continuously or periodically analyzes the contents of all Long Text Area fields to identify the presence of regulated or personal data.

**SBS-DATA-002: Maintain an Inventory of Long Text Area Fields Containing Regulated Data**  
The organization must maintain an up-to-date inventory of all Long Text Area fields that are known or detected to contain regulated or personal data.
