# About

## Purpose and Independence

SBS is an **independent, community-driven security standard**. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Salesforce, Inc., or any specific vendor. While contributors include practitioners from Salesforce security tooling vendors, the benchmark itself is vendor-neutral and serves the broader Salesforce security community—including administrators, architects, auditors, consultants, and security tool vendors of all types.

The benchmark is published openly to enable:
- Objective security assessments by internal teams and external auditors
- Automated compliance scanning by security tooling vendors
- Consistent security expectations across organizations and consultancies
- Continuous improvement through community contributions and feedback

## Chief Editor

[Pablo Gonzalez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablis/) serves as Chief Editor of SBS, overseeing the benchmark's structure, consistency, and release cadence. Pablo originally authored the benchmark during his work as Director of Research and Product Management at AutoRABIT, emerging from his research into security posture management for Salesforce and systematic analysis of security requirements across enterprise deployments.

## Contributors

SBS has received contributions and review from Salesforce security practitioners, architects, and industry leaders who have helped refine and validate the controls within this benchmark. Contributors participate as individuals, and their inclusion does not imply that their employer endorses this standard or any organization using it. Named contributors will be acknowledged for their material contributions to control development, audit procedures, and domain expertise.
