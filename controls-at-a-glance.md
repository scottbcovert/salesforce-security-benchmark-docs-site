# Controls At-a-Glance

This page provides a quick reference to all SBS control statements. Each control statement is a concise, single-sentence summary of the requirement. For full details including rationale, audit procedures, and remediation steps, refer to the individual control sections.

Organizations must formally install all connected apps and must control access to each installed app exclusively through assigned profiles or permission sets.

**SBS-OAUTH-002: Inventory and Criticality Classification of OAuth-Enabled Connected Apps**  
All OAuth-enabled Connected Apps must be recorded in an authoritative system of record and assigned a documented vendor criticality rating reflecting integration importance and data sensitivity.

**SBS-OAUTH-003: Due Diligence Documentation for High-Risk Connected App Vendors**  
Organizations must review and retain available security documentation for all high-risk Connected App vendors and explicitly record any missing documentation as part of the vendor assessment.

## Integrations

**SBS-INT-001: Enforce Governance of Browser Extensions Accessing Salesforce**  
Organizations must enforce a centrally managed mechanism that restricts which browser extensions are permitted to access Salesforce, and must not allow the use of unmanaged or uncontrolled extensions.

**SBS-INT-002: Inventory and Justification of Remote Site Settings**  
Organizations must maintain an authoritative inventory of all Remote Site Settings and document a business justification for each endpoint approved for Apex HTTP callouts.

**SBS-INT-003: Inventory and Justification of Named Credentials**  
Organizations must maintain an authoritative inventory of all Named Credentials and document a business justification for each external endpoint and authentication configuration approved for use in Salesforce.

**SBS-INT-004: Retain API Total Usage Event Logs for 30 Days**  
The organization must retain API Total Usage event log data (EventLogFile EventType=ApiTotalUsage) for at least the immediately preceding 30 days using Salesforce-native retention or automated external export and storage.

## Access Controls

**SBS-ACS-001: Enforce a Documented Permission Set Model**  
All permission sets, permission set groups, and profiles must conform to a documented model maintained in a system of record and enforced continuously.

**SBS-ACS-002: Documented Justification for All `API-Enabled` Authorizations**  
Every authorization granting the "API Enabled" permission must have documented business or technical justification recorded in a system of record.

**SBS-ACS-003: Documented Justification for `Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps` Permission**  
The "Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps" permission must only be assigned to highly trusted users with documented justification and must not be granted to end-users.

**SBS-ACS-004: Documented Justification for All Super Admin–Equivalent Users**  
All users with simultaneous View All Data, Modify All Data, and Manage Users permissions must be documented in a system of record with clear business or technical justification.

**SBS-ACS-005: Only Use Custom Profiles for Active Users**  
All active users must be assigned custom profiles. The out-of-the-box standard profiles must not be used.

**SBS-ACS-006: Documented Justification for `Use Any API Client` Permission**  
The "Use Any API Client" permission must only be assigned to highly trusted users with documented justification and must not be granted to end-users.

**SBS-ACS-007: Maintain Inventory of Non-Human Identities**
Organizations must maintain an authoritative inventory of all non-human identities, including integration users, automation users, bot users, and API-only accounts.

**SBS-ACS-008: Restrict Broad Privileges for Non-Human Identities**
Non-human identities must not be assigned permissions that bypass sharing rules or grant administrative capabilities unless documented business justification exists.

**SBS-ACS-009: Implement Compensating Controls for Privileged Non-Human Identities**
Non-human identities with permissions that bypass sharing rules or grant administrative capabilities must have compensating controls implemented to mitigate risk.


## Authentication

**SBS-AUTH-001: Enforce Single Sign-On for All Standard Production Users**  
Salesforce production orgs must enforce Single Sign-On (SSO) for all standard users by enabling the org-level setting that disables Salesforce credential logins and assigning the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission to all non-exempt accounts.

**SBS-AUTH-002: Govern and Document All Users Permitted to Bypass Single Sign-On**  
All users who do not have the "Is Single Sign-On Enabled" permission must be explicitly authorized, documented in a system of record, and limited to approved administrative or break-glass use cases.

**SBS-AUTH-003: Prohibit Broad or Unrestricted Profile Login IP Ranges**  
Profiles in Salesforce production orgs must not contain login IP ranges that effectively permit access from the full public internet or other overly broad ranges that bypass network-based access controls.

**SBS-AUTH-004: Enforce Strong Multi-Factor Authentication for External Users with Substantial Access to Sensitive Data**
All Salesforce interactive authentication flows for external human users with substantial access to sensitive data must enforce multi-factor authentication that includes at least one strong authentication factor.

## Code Security

**SBS-CODE-001: Mandatory Peer Review for Salesforce Code Changes**  
All Salesforce code changes must undergo peer review and receive approval before merging into any production-bound branch.

**SBS-CODE-002: Pre-Merge Static Code Analysis for Apex and LWC**  
Static code analysis with security checks for Apex and Lightning Web Components must execute successfully before any code change is merged into a production-bound branch.

**SBS-CODE-003: Implement Persistent Apex Application Logging**  
Organizations must implement an Apex-based logging framework that writes application log events to durable Salesforce storage and must not rely on transient Salesforce debug logs for operational or security investigations.

## Data Security

**SBS-DATA-001: Implement Mechanisms to Detect Regulated Data in Long Text Area Fields**  
The organization must implement a mechanism that continuously or periodically analyzes the contents of all Long Text Area fields to identify the presence of regulated or personal data.

**SBS-DATA-002: Maintain an Inventory of Long Text Area Fields Containing Regulated Data**  
The organization must maintain an up-to-date inventory of all Long Text Area fields that are known or detected to contain regulated or personal data.

## Deployments

**SBS-DEP-001: Require a Designated Deployment Identity for Metadata Changes**  
Salesforce production orgs must designate a single deployment identity that is exclusively used for all metadata deployments and high-risk configuration changes performed through automated or scripted release processes.

**SBS-DEP-002: Establish and Maintain a List of High-Risk Metadata Types Prohibited from Direct Production Editing**  
Salesforce production orgs must maintain an explicit list of high-risk metadata types that must never be edited directly in production by human users, defaulting at minimum to the SBS baseline list while allowing organizations to extend or refine it as needed.

**SBS-DEP-003: Monitor and Alert on Unauthorized Modifications to High-Risk Metadata**  
Salesforce production orgs must implement a monitoring capability that detects and reports any modification to high-risk metadata performed by a user other than the designated deployment identity.

**SBS-DEP-004: Establish Source-Driven Development Process**  
Meaningful Salesforce metadata changes must be deployed through a source-driven, automated, and deterministic deployment process, except where the platform does not provide programmatic deployment support.

## Security Configuration

**SBS-SECCONF-001: Establish a Salesforce Health Check Baseline**  
Salesforce production orgs must define and maintain a Salesforce Health Check baseline—including Salesforce's native baseline XML or an equivalent customized baseline—and ensure it reflects the organization's intentional security configuration posture.

**SBS-SECCONF-002: Review and Remediate Salesforce Health Check Deviations**  
Salesforce production orgs must periodically review Health Check results against the defined baseline and remediate deviations or formally document approved exceptions.
