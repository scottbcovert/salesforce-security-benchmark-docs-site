## Naming and Branding Guidance

While this license legally permits modification and redistribution, **we ask the community to respect the following naming conventions:**

### ✅ Acceptable Uses

- "Implements Security Benchmark for Salesforce (SBS) v1.0"
- "Built for SBS compliance"
- "Based on SBS"
- "SBS-compatible scanner"
- "Provides SBS compliance reporting"

### ❌ Requested Restrictions

Please **do not** use the name "SBS" or "Security Benchmark for Salesforce" for modified or forked versions. If you create a derivative work, please use a different name and clearly indicate it is derived from SBS.

**Example:**
- ❌ "Acme Corp Security Benchmark for Salesforce"
- ❌ "Extended SBS by Acme Corp"
- ✅ "Acme Security Controls (based on SBS v1.0)"

### Why This Matters

The legitimacy and value of SBS come from community consensus around a single, canonical standard. Fragmented or rebranded versions dilute that value and create confusion in the ecosystem.

**This is a community request, not a legal restriction.** We rely on the good faith of the Salesforce security community to maintain SBS as a unified standard.
