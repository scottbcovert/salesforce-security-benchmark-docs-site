## Access Controls

This section defines controls related to permission sets, permission set groups, profiles, and access governance within Salesforce environments. These controls ensure that organizations maintain a structured, documented, and enforced approach to authorization management, reducing privilege sprawl and unauthorized access risks.

### SBS-ACS-001: Enforce a Documented Permission Set Model

**Control Statement:** All permission sets, permission set groups, and profiles must conform to a documented model maintained in a system of record and enforced continuously.

**Description:**  
The organization must define, document, and enforce a standardized permission set model within its system of record. A permission set model defines how the organization structures permissions—for example, using permission set groups to represent personas or departments, and permission sets to represent specific actions or capabilities. The specific structure is determined by the organization, but all profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups must conform to the documented model. No permission constructs may exist outside the defined model, and compliance must be evaluated and enforced on a near real-time basis.

**Example models:**
- Permission set groups represent job roles (Sales Rep, Service Agent), and individual permission sets represent capabilities (View Reports, Edit Accounts)
- Permission set groups represent departments (Sales, Marketing), and permission sets represent access tiers (Standard, Advanced)
- Permission sets represent business functions with no grouping hierarchy

**Risk:** <Badge type="warning" text="High" />  
Without a documented and enforced permission set model, organizations lose visibility into their authorization structure—accumulating ad hoc permission constructs created for one-time needs that are never reviewed or removed. This results in privilege sprawl, inconsistent access patterns, and inability to audit who has what access and why. Security teams cannot assess authorization posture, detect drift, or investigate access-related incidents when no authoritative model exists to compare against. The lack of continuous enforcement means unauthorized or excessive permissions can persist indefinitely without detection.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Obtain the organization's documented permission set model from the designated system of record.  
2. Enumerate all Profiles, Permission Sets, and Permission Set Groups using Salesforce Setup, Metadata API, or Tooling API.  
3. Compare each enumerated item against the documented model to determine whether:  
   - Its purpose or persona aligns with the model.  
   - Its included permissions conform to the model's structure and boundaries.  
   - Its naming and classification match the documented conventions.  
4. Identify any profiles, permission sets, or permission set groups that do not conform to the model.  
5. Verify that the organization has a process or automation that enforces model compliance in near real time (e.g., continuous scanning, pipelines, or governance workflows).

**Remediation:**  
1. Update or deprecate noncompliant profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups to align with the documented permission set model.  
2. Migrate users off legacy or misaligned authorization constructs.  
3. Implement or enhance automated enforcement to ensure continuous alignment with the defined model.  
4. Update the system-of-record documentation as the model changes.

**Default Value:**  
Salesforce does not enforce any specific permission set model. Profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups can be created without structure or alignment unless governed by the organization.

### SBS-ACS-002: Documented Justification for All `API-Enabled` Authorizations

**Control Statement:** Every authorization granting the `API Enabled` permission must have documented business or technical justification recorded in a system of record.

**Description:**  
All profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups that grant the `API Enabled` permission must be recorded in a designated system of record with a documented business or technical justification for requiring API access. Any authorization lacking documented rationale is noncompliant.

**Risk:** <Badge type="warning" text="High" />  
Without documented justification for API-enabled authorizations, organizations lose visibility into which users and systems can programmatically access Salesforce data at scale. The `API Enabled` permission enables large-scale data extraction, bulk modification, and automated operations—capabilities that create significant exposure when granted without oversight. Undocumented API access paths accumulate over time, preventing security teams from assessing data exfiltration risk, investigating suspicious API activity, or enforcing least privilege across automated access patterns.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Enumerate all profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups that include the `API Enabled` permission using Salesforce Setup, Metadata API, Tooling API, or an automated scanner.  
2. Compare the enumerated list against the organization’s designated system of record for API-enabled authorizations.  
3. Verify that every profile, permission set, and permission set group granting “API Enabled” has a corresponding entry in the system of record.  
4. Confirm that each entry includes:  
   - A clear business or technical justification for API access, and  
   - Any applicable exception or approval documentation.  
5. Flag as noncompliant any authorizations lacking documentation or justification.

**Remediation:**  
1. Remove the `API Enabled` permission from any profile, permission set, or permission set group that lacks a documented justification and is not required for business operations.  
2. For any authorization that legitimately requires API access, add or update the rationale in the system of record to clearly justify the need.  
3. Reconcile and update the system of record to ensure complete and accurate inventory of all API-enabled authorizations.

**Default Value:**  
Salesforce does not require or maintain a system of record for API-enabled authorizations. The `API Enabled` permission is disabled by default for standard profiles but may be granted by administrators.

### SBS-ACS-003: Documented Justification for `Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps` Permission

**Control Statement:** The `Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps` permission must only be assigned to highly trusted users with documented justification and must not be granted to end-users.

**Description:**  
All profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups that grant the `Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps` permission must be recorded in a designated system of record with a documented business or technical justification. This permission should only be assigned to highly trusted users, such as administrators and developers involved in managing or testing connected app integrations. Any authorization lacking documented rationale is noncompliant.

**Risk:** <Badge type="danger" text="Critical" />  
The `Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps` permission allows users to bypass Connected App usage restrictions and self-authorize any OAuth application without administrator approval. This establishes an uncontrolled security boundary: users with this permission can grant external applications access to Salesforce data without oversight, enabling data exfiltration, unauthorized integrations, and potential account compromise. Unlike other permissions that require additional failures to exploit, this permission directly enables unauthorized third-party access the moment it is misassigned—making it a primary security boundary that must be tightly controlled.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Enumerate all profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups that include the `Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps` permission using Salesforce Setup, Metadata API, Tooling API, or an automated scanner.  
2. Compare the enumerated list against the organization's designated system of record for this permission.  
3. Verify that every profile, permission set, and permission set group granting "Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps" has a corresponding entry in the system of record.  
4. Confirm that each entry includes:  
   - A clear business or technical justification for requiring this permission,  
   - Identification of the user role or persona (e.g., administrator, developer, integration manager),  
   - Any applicable exception or approval documentation, and  
   - Confirmation that the use case is limited to testing or managing connected app integrations.  
5. Verify that the permission is not assigned to end-user profiles or permission sets intended for general business users.  
6. Flag as noncompliant any authorizations lacking documentation, justification, or assigned to unauthorized user populations.

**Remediation:**  
1. Remove the `Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps` permission from any profile, permission set, or permission set group that lacks a documented justification or is assigned to end-users.  
2. For any authorization that legitimately requires this permission (e.g., administrators or developers testing connected apps), add or update the rationale in the system of record to clearly justify the need and identify the specific role or use case.  
3. Ensure that connected apps required for business operations are properly installed and allowlisted rather than relying on this permission for end-user access.  
4. Reconcile and update the system of record to ensure complete and accurate inventory of all assignments of this permission.

**Default Value:**  
The `Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps` permission is not granted by default in Salesforce. This permission was introduced in September 2025 as part of Connected App Usage Restrictions changes. Organizations must explicitly assign this permission to users who require it for legitimate testing or integration management purposes.

### SBS-ACS-004: Documented Justification for All Super Admin–Equivalent Users

**Control Statement:** All users with simultaneous `View All Data`, `Modify All Data`, and `Manage Users` permissions must be documented in a system of record with clear business or technical justification.

**Description:**  
All users who hold *simultaneous* authorization for `View All Data`, `Modify All Data`, and `Manage Users`—collectively constituting Super Admin–level access—must be identified and documented in the system of record with a clear business or technical justification. Any user with this combination of permissions who lacks documented rationale is noncompliant.

**Risk:** <Badge type="warning" text="High" />  
Without documented justification for Super Admin–equivalent users, organizations lose visibility into who possesses unrestricted access to the entire Salesforce environment. These users can read and modify all data, manage user accounts, and alter the security posture of the org without oversight. Undocumented Super Admin access prevents security teams from assessing breach impact, investigating administrative actions, or maintaining accountability for the most sensitive operations. The inability to identify and justify these users also prevents effective access reviews and creates persistent exposure from forgotten or orphaned administrative accounts.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Enumerate all users who simultaneously possess the following permissions through any profile, permission set, or permission set group:  
   - `View All Data`
   - `Modify All Data`  
   - `Manage Users`
2. Compile a list of all users meeting the criteria for Super Admin–equivalent access.  
3. Compare the list against the organization’s system of record.  
4. Verify that each Super Admin–equivalent user has corresponding documentation that includes:  
   - A clear business or technical justification for requiring this level of access, and  
   - Any relevant exception or approval records.  
5. Flag as noncompliant any users with Super Admin–equivalent access lacking documentation or justification.

**Remediation:**  
1. Remove one or more of the Super Admin–equivalent permissions from any user who does not have a documented business or technical justification.  
2. For users who legitimately require this level of access, add or update rationale within the system of record.  
3. Reassess user access to ensure alignment with least privilege, reducing broad permissions where narrower privileges are sufficient.

**Default Value:**  
Salesforce does not limit the number of users who may receive these permissions, and does not maintain any system of record regarding administrative access.

### SBS-ACS-005: Only Use Custom Profiles for Active Users

**Control Statement:**
All active users must be assigned custom profiles. The out-of-the-box standard profiles must not be used.

**Description:**  
Any regular user that can access the org, must use a custom profile. If a user has one of the standard profiles (e.g. "System Administrator", "Standard User", "Salesforce - Minimum Access"), the user is non-compliant. This only affects personal users, not machine users that use the default "API Only" permission sets.

**Risk:** <Badge type="warning" text="High" />  
Standard profiles are managed by Salesforce, not the organization—meaning Salesforce can enable permissions and object access on these profiles when features are released or platform updates occur without administrator approval. This creates an uncontrolled change vector: users assigned to standard profiles may gain new capabilities unexpectedly, bypassing the organization's authorization governance. Standard profiles are also overly permissive by default (e.g., "Standard User" grants "View Setup," "System Administrator" grants developer-level permissions), making it impossible to enforce least privilege. Without custom profiles, organizations cannot investigate authorization changes or maintain accountability for who approved which permissions.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Enumerate all **human** users that are "Active" (`IsActive = true` on the user flag)
2. Flag all users noncompliant that use a standard profile (`IsCustom = false` on the profile metadata)

**Remediation:**  
1. Setup a custom profile for each standard profile that is used
2. Manage permissions and object access on these profiles to be compliant with the other controls of the SBS
3. Assign the new custom profiles to your active users, following the principle of "least privilege access"

**Default Value:**  
Salesforce does not require to create and assign custom profiles.

### SBS-ACS-006: Documented Justification for `Use Any API Client` Permission

**Control Statement:** The `Use Any API Client` permission, which bypasses default behavior in orgs with "API Access Control" enabled, must only be assigned to highly trusted users with documented justification and must not be granted to end-users.

**Description:**  
All profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups that grant the `Use Any API Client` permission must be recorded in a designated system of record with a documented business or technical justification. This permission should only be assigned to highly trusted users, such as administrators and developers involved in managing or testing connected app integrations. Any authorization lacking documented rationale is noncompliant.

**Risk:** <Badge type="danger" text="Critical" />  
The `Use Any API Client` permission allows users to bypass API Access Control entirely, authorizing any OAuth-connected application without requiring it to be pre-vetted or allowlisted. This establishes an uncontrolled security boundary: users with this permission can grant data access to arbitrary external applications, enabling data exfiltration, unauthorized integrations, and potential account compromise without administrator oversight. Granting this permission to unauthorized personnel completely defeats the purpose of API Access Control, creating a direct path to unauthorized third-party access that requires no other control to fail.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Enumerate all profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups that include the `Use Any API Client` permission using Salesforce Setup, Metadata API, Tooling API, or an automated scanner.  
2. Compare the enumerated list against the organization's designated system of record for this permission.  
3. Verify that every profile, permission set, and permission set group granting `Use Any API Client` has a corresponding entry in the system of record.  
4. Confirm that each entry includes:  
   - A clear business or technical justification for requiring this permission,  
   - Identification of the user role or persona (e.g., administrator, developer, integration manager),  
   - Any applicable exception or approval documentation, and  
   - Confirmation that the use case is limited to testing or managing connected app integrations.  
5. Verify that the permission is not assigned to end-user profiles or permission sets intended for general business users.  
6. Flag as noncompliant any authorizations lacking documentation, justification, or assigned to unauthorized user populations.

**Remediation:**  
1. Remove the `Use Any API Client` permission from any profile, permission set, or permission set group that lacks a documented justification or is assigned to end-users.  
2. For any authorization that legitimately requires this permission (e.g., administrators or developers testing connected apps), add or update the rationale in the system of record to clearly justify the need and identify the specific role or use case.  
3. Ensure that connected apps required for business operations are properly vetted and allowlisted rather than relying on this permission for end-user access.  
4. Reconcile and update the system of record to ensure complete and accurate inventory of all assignments of this permission.

**Default Value:**  
The `Use Any API Client` permission is not granted by default in Salesforce. Organizations must explicitly assign this permission to users who require it for legitimate testing or integration management purposes.


### SBS-ACS-007: Maintain Inventory of Non-Human Identities

**Control Statement:** Organizations must maintain an authoritative inventory of all non-human identities, including integration users, automation users, bot users, and API-only accounts.

**Description:**  
Non-human identities operate without direct human oversight and often possess persistent credentials with elevated access. Organizations must maintain a complete and current inventory of all such identities to enable effective governance, access reviews, and incident response. The inventory must include identity type, purpose, owner, creation date, and last activity date.

**Risk:** <Badge type="warning" text="High" />  
Without a comprehensive inventory of non-human identities, organizations cannot detect, investigate, or respond to security incidents involving automated access. Non-human identities are frequently created for integrations or automation projects and then forgotten—accumulating as orphaned accounts with persistent credentials and elevated access. Security teams cannot assess which automated systems access Salesforce data, identify compromised integration credentials, or scope the impact of a vendor breach. This loss of visibility prevents effective governance of automated access and creates persistent security exposure from untracked machine accounts.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Request the organization's inventory of non-human identities
2. Query Salesforce for all users where `IsActive = true` and any of the following conditions apply:
   - Username contains "integration", "api", "bot", "automation", or "service"
   - Profile name contains "Integration", "API", or similar indicators
   - User has "API Only User" permission enabled
   - User is associated with Einstein Bot or Flow automation
3. Compare the inventory to the query results to identify discrepancies
4. Verify the inventory includes: identity name, type, purpose, business owner, creation date, and last login date
5. Confirm the inventory is reviewed and updated at least quarterly

**Remediation:**  
1. Query Salesforce to identify all potential non-human identities using the criteria in the audit procedure
2. For each identified identity, document: name, type (integration/bot/API), purpose, business owner, creation date
3. Establish a process to update the inventory when non-human identities are created, modified, or deactivated
4. Implement quarterly reviews of the inventory to identify and deactivate unused accounts
5. Store the inventory in an authoritative system of record accessible to security and compliance teams

**Default Value:**  
Salesforce does not provide a built-in inventory or classification system for non-human identities. Organizations must create and maintain this inventory manually or through third-party tools.

### SBS-ACS-008: Restrict Broad Privileges for Non-Human Identities

**Control Statement:** Non-human identities must not be assigned permissions that bypass sharing rules or grant administrative capabilities unless documented business justification exists.

**Description:**  
Non-human identities should follow the principle of least privilege and be granted only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their intended function. Permissions that bypass object-level or record-level security (such as View All Data, Modify All Data) or grant administrative capabilities (such as Manage Users, Modify Metadata) create significant security risk when assigned to automated accounts. Organizations must document a specific business justification for any non-human identity that requires such permissions.

**Risk:** <Badge type="warning" text="High" />  
Without documented justification for broad non-human identity privileges, organizations lose visibility into which automated systems can bypass sharing rules or perform administrative operations. Non-human identities operate without human judgment, making over-privileged automation a high-impact target—compromised credentials can result in complete data extraction, system-wide configuration changes, or persistent backdoor access. Many non-human identities are granted excessive permissions during initial setup and never reviewed, creating long-lived security exposure that security teams cannot detect, investigate, or remediate without knowing which identities have which privileges and why.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Using the non-human identity inventory from SBS-ACS-006, identify all non-human identities
2. For each non-human identity, query assigned permissions through profiles, permission sets, and permission set groups
3. Flag any non-human identity with one or more of the following permissions:
   - View All Data
   - Modify All Data
   - Manage Users
   - Author Apex
   - Customize Application
   - Any permission that bypasses sharing rules or grants administrative access
4. For each flagged identity, verify that documented business justification exists explaining why the permission is required
5. Confirm the justification was approved by appropriate stakeholders (security, compliance, or management)

**Remediation:**  
1. For each non-human identity with broad privileges, evaluate whether the permission is genuinely required for the identity's function
2. Remove broad privileges that are not necessary; replace with more granular permissions where possible
3. For non-human identities that legitimately require broad privileges, document:
   - Specific business function requiring the permission
   - Why more granular permissions cannot satisfy the requirement
   - Business owner and technical owner
   - Approval from security or compliance team
4. Implement a formal approval process for granting broad privileges to non-human identities
5. Establish periodic review (at least annually) of all non-human identities with broad privileges

**Default Value:**  
Salesforce does not restrict the assignment of broad privileges to non-human identities. Administrators can grant any permission to any user type without requiring justification or approval.

### SBS-ACS-009: Implement Compensating Controls for Privileged Non-Human Identities

**Control Statement:** Non-human identities with permissions that bypass sharing rules or grant administrative capabilities must have compensating controls implemented to mitigate risk.

**Description:**  
When non-human identities require broad privileges for legitimate business purposes, organizations must implement defense-in-depth protections to reduce the risk of credential compromise or misuse. Compensating controls include IP address restrictions, OAuth scope limitations, activity monitoring and alerting, credential rotation policies, and dedicated identities per integration. Multiple compensating controls should be implemented based on the sensitivity of accessible data and the scope of granted permissions.

**Risk:** <Badge type="tip" text="Moderate" />  
Without compensating controls, privileged non-human identities rely solely on credential secrecy for protection—a single point of failure. Unlike human users, these identities typically use persistent credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, certificates) that do not expire and are not protected by multi-factor authentication. Compensating controls provide defense-in-depth: IP restrictions limit where credentials can be used, monitoring enables detection of compromise, and credential rotation limits the window of exposure. However, other controls (SBS-ACS-008) still govern whether broad privileges are granted; compensating controls reduce blast radius rather than establishing the primary security boundary.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Using the results from SBS-ACS-007, identify all non-human identities with broad privileges that have documented business justification
2. For each privileged non-human identity, verify that at least two of the following compensating controls are implemented:
   - **IP Address Restrictions:** Profile or permission set restricts login to specific IP ranges
   - **OAuth Scope Limitations:** Connected app uses minimal OAuth scopes; refresh tokens have expiration
   - **Activity Monitoring:** Automated monitoring alerts on unusual activity (off-hours access, high volume, geographic anomalies)
   - **Credential Rotation:** Credentials are rotated at least every 90 days
   - **Dedicated Identity:** Separate identity per integration (not shared across multiple systems)
3. Verify that monitoring alerts are actively reviewed and responded to
4. Confirm that compensating controls are documented in the justification for the privileged access

**Remediation:**  
1. For each privileged non-human identity, implement IP address restrictions in the assigned profile or permission set to limit access to known integration sources
2. For OAuth-based integrations, configure connected apps with minimal required scopes and enable refresh token expiration
3. Implement automated monitoring for privileged non-human identity activity using Event Monitoring, Shield Event Monitoring, or third-party SSPM tools
4. Establish credential rotation policies requiring API keys, passwords, and certificates to be rotated at least every 90 days
5. Ensure each integration uses a dedicated non-human identity rather than sharing credentials across multiple systems
6. Document all implemented compensating controls in the access justification

**Default Value:**  
Salesforce does not require or enforce compensating controls for privileged non-human identities. IP restrictions, OAuth scopes, monitoring, and credential rotation must be configured manually by administrators.
Salesforce does not require creating and assigning custom profiles.

### SBS-ACS-010: Enforce Periodic Access Review and Recertification

**Control Statement:** All user access and configuration influencing permissions and sharing must be formally reviewed and recertified at least annually by designated busines stakeholders, with documented approval and remediation of unauthorized or excessive access.

**Description:** The organization must implement a periodic access review process that ensures all active user access (human and non-human) is intentional, necessary, and aligned with current job responsibilities. An access review encompasses all authorization constructs including user profiles, permission set assignments, permission set group memberships, and role hierarchies. A designated business stakeholder (typically a manager, department lead, or data owner) must certify that each user's access is appropriate, with documented evidence of review and approval. Any access identified as excessive, outdated, or no longer required must be documented and remediated within a defined timeframe. The review must include both individual user access and permission construct usage.

The process must establish clear ownership, defined frequency (minimum annual but may be more frequent for sensitive roles or data), and tracked remediation of findings. Organizations may conduct reviews by individual, by business unit, by data classification, or by application—but all access must be reviewed at least annually in aggregate.

**Example implementations:**
* Annual access reviews conducted by department managers in Q1, with remediation required within 30 days; tracked in a centralized system of record with sign-off by a representative of Business and Security
* Rolling quarterly reviews where each business unit certifies access for their users on a rotating schedule, with all users reviewed within the calendar year
* Role-based reviews where each application owner certifies all users assigned to specific permission sets or profiles, ensuring full coverage across all users annually
* Sensitive role reviews conducted semi-annually (e.g., System Administrator, Finance, HR users) while standard users are reviewed annually

**Risk:** <Badge type="tip" text="Moderate" /> Access review is the foundational control for preventing privilege creep, detecting unauthorized access, and remediating execessive permissions. Without periodic review, users accumulate access over time -- permissions granted for past roles remain after job changes, access added for temporary projects becomes permanent, and no formal mechanism ensures access remains least-privilege. Periodic formal recertification by business stakeholders ensures that access governance remains aligned with organizational reality. Documentation of review creates an audit trail and ensures accountability. Regular remediation prevents drift and maintains the integrity of the permission set model defined in SBS-ACS-001.

**Audit Procedure:**
1. Understand the organization's dcoumented access review policy, including:
   * Defined frequency and review cycle
   * Designated reviewers and escalation path
   * Intended coverage scope and access types included
   * Expected remediation timeframe for findings
   * System of record for tracking review activity and findings.
2. Assess the recency and regularity of access review execution. Locate the most recent completed acccess review cycle and evaluate whether it aligns with the organization's stated review frequency.
3. Examine a representative sample of access review documentation to asssess consistency of execution:
   * Evidence of review and approval by the designated stakeholder
   * Documentation of review date and scope
   * Any findings, exceptions, or questions raised during the review
   * Appropriateness of sample size relative to the organization's user population and complexity
4. For any access identified as excessive, unauthorized, or not recertified:
   * Assess whether the finding was documented
   * Evaluate what remediation action was taken or whether exceptions were formally approved
   * Compare remediation timing against the defined SLA
5. Assess whether the organization maintains a traceable system of record that documents:
   * Who reviewed what access
   * When the review occurred
   * What was approved or questioned
   * What remediation was required and its completion status
6. Evaluate whether the access review process adequately addresses the organization's primary access constructs, which may include the following types of assignment:
   * User profiles
   * Permission sets
   * Permission set groups
   * Role and role hierarchies
   * Public group 
   * Queues
   * Sales Territories
   * Delegated administration or elevated permissions

**Remediation:**
1. If no access review process exists, establish documented policy including frequency, reviewers, scope, and remediation SLAs.
2. Conduct an initial comprehensive access review of all active users, with business unit or department ownership of sign-off.
3. Identify and remediate all access determined excessive, unauthorized, or inappropriate during the initial review.
4. Implement a system of record (spreadsheet, governance tool, or integrated platform) to track reviews, findings, and remediation.
5. Schedule recurring access reviews at minimum annual frequency, with quarterly reviews for sensitive roles or high-risk data.
6. Document the review process, including templates, stakeholder roles, and escalation procedures.
7. Establish accountability for reviewers and tie review completion to performance management or audit requirements.

**Default Value:** Salesforce does not automatically initiate user access reviews or require stakeholder recertification of access. Organizations must manually track and document access review processes. Without a defined process, access authorization decisions are not systematically validated, and no audit trail of business stakeholder approval exists.

### SBS-ACS-011: Enforce Governance of Access and Authorization Changes

**Control Statement:** All changes to Salesforce user access and authorization must be governed through a documented process that requires approval, records business justification, and produces an auditable record of the change.

**Description:**  
Organizations must enforce governance over all changes that grant, modify, or revoke access within Salesforce. Access and authorization changes must be requested, approved prior to implementation, and traceable to a documented business justification.

This control applies to changes including, but not limited to:
- User creation, modification, or deactivation
- Assignment or removal of profiles, permission sets, or permission set groups
- Changes to profile or permission set permissions
- Role hierarchy changes
- Public group, queue, or territory access changes
- Sharing rule or restriction rule changes affecting access

Access changes must be auditable and aligned to the organization's documented access model. Unauthorized or undocumented changes represent control failure.

**Risk:** <Badge type="warning" text="High" />  
Without enforced governance over access changes, organizations lose visibility and control over how privileges are granted and modified. Ad hoc access changes increase the risk of excessive privileges, unauthorized access, and violations of least-privilege principles. The absence of approval, justification, or auditability impairs incident investigation, undermines access reviews, and weakens compliance evidence for audits involving identity, access management, and change control.

**Audit Procedure:**  
1. Retrieve evidence of the organization's documented process governing access and authorization changes.  
2. Identify access-related changes made during a representative review period.  
3. For a sample of changes, verify:  
   - An approval record exists prior to implementation  
   - Business justification is documented  
   - The change is traceable to an identifiable request  
   - The implemented change is recorded in available audit or change history records  
4. Identify any access changes lacking approval, justification, or auditability as noncompliant.

**Remediation:**  
1. Establish and document a formal governance process for access and authorization changes.  
2. Require approval and business justification for all access modifications.  
3. Ensure access changes are recorded in an auditable system of record.

**Default Value:**  
Salesforce does not enforce approval workflows or governance for access and authorization changes. Administrators can directly modify users, permissions, roles, and sharing settings without documented approval or justification. While certain changes may appear in audit logs, governance enforcement is dependent on organizational policy and external processes.
